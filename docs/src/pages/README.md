# Cats Effect Tutorial

## What

This is a self-guided tutorial to [Cats Effect][ce]. It's a combination of text (which you're reading now) and code that you have to complete. 


## How 

If you were to ask a Shakespearean character to describe this tutorial, they would probably say something poetic but pithy, like “Tis brief, my lord”. It is designed to be used in a group, and our goal is to provide only enough material to start exploration and discussion. We refer you to other resources for in-depth explanations:

- [Essential Effects][ee], the most comprehensive resource on everything Cats Effect;
- [the Typelevel documentation][ce], which is a bit patchy but nonetheless has some useful material; and
- [Functional Programming Strategies][fps], covers background concepts like monads and interpreters but doesn't directly address Cats Effect.

You should clone [this repository][repo] to your computer. In `code/src/main/scala/` there are various code challenges you will work with. The text will tell you when to tackle each challenge.
