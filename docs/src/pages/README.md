# Cats Effect Tutorial

This is a self-guided tutorial to [Cats Effect][ce]. It's a combination of text (which you're reading now) and code that you have to complete. 

You should clone this repository to your computer. In `code/src/main/scala/` there are various code challenges you will work with. The text will tell you when to tackle each challenge.

To start with we should explain what an effect is, and hence the problem that Cats Effect is solving. There is already an [excellent blog post][effect] that does just that, so go and read it now.
