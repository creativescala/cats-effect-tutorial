# Cats Effect Tutorial

This is a self-guided tutorial to [Cats Effect][ce]. It's a combination of text (which you're reading now) and code that you have to complete. 

You should clone [this repository][repo] to your computer. In `code/src/main/scala/` there are various code challenges you will work with. The text will tell you when to tackle each challenge.

If you were to ask a Shakespearean character to describe this tutorial, they would probably say something like 'Tis brief, my lord'. The goal is to provide only enough material to get you going, and to link out to other resources for in-depth discussion. We particularly recommend the following:

- [Essential Effects][ee], the most comprehensive resource on everything Cats Effect;
- [the Typelevel documentation][ce], which is a bit patchy but nonetheless has some useful material; and
- [Functional Programming Strategies][fps], covers background concepts like monads and interpreters but doesn't directly address Cats Effect.
