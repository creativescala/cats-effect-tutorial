# Cats Effect Tutorial

This is a self-guided tutorial on Cats Effect. What is Cats Effect, you might ask? Is it [the zoomies][zoom] for example? Whilst the zoomies are certainly something that has an effect on cats, in this case Cats Effect is a [software library][ce] for handing "effects" in Scala code. By effects we mean things like concurrency and error-handling. We'll define this more precisely soon.

This introduction to Cats Effect is designed to be very hands on, and relies on external resources for in-depth explanations of some points. We recommend:

- [Essential Effects][ee], the most comprehensive resource on everything Cats Effect;
- [the Typelevel documentation][ce], which is a bit patchy but nonetheless has some useful material; and
- [Functional Programming Strategies][fps], covers background concepts like monads and interpreters but doesn't directly address Cats Effect.
